Driven by my Aha moment [from week two](/post/2019/week-2-humble-pie/) (and Greg's suggestion) I wanted to outline a mental model of blockly using a simple example. Here we will create 3 "blocks":

* *CreateDataSet* a dataset block that contains data (the number 0)
* *IncrementDataSet* an intermediate transformation block (a step function to increase the data by one)
* *DisplayDataSet* a display block (a pop up alert of our new value).

Before we even touch blockly we can create an object that   are strung together we will recieve the output: 1.

```{js}
```
