I spent the beginning of the week pouring over the Blockly documentation which is sparse, at best. The Google team does a great job of explaining how to create a single block, but I struggled to create a big picture of how blocks interact. 

After arranging a call with whom I thought was a developer of Blockly, [Beka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beka-westberg-88b777157/) turned out to be an incredibly knowledgeable and driven high school student!!! [#goals] and clarified my misconceptions. 

Blocks are designed using the `Blockly.Block` function for javascript or `Blockly.defineBlocksWithJsonArray` using JSON. This is where you specify the block shape, inputs, and outputs.

```{javascript}
Blockly.defineBlocksWithJsonArray([
 {
   // block type, using the prefix data_ we can create lots of different data blocks
   // and keep code organized by giving them all the same prefix
   // this must be a unique identifier! 
   // Here I'm using the iris dataset. Unique, I know.
  "type": "data_iris",
   // this is what will be printed on the block
  "message0": "load iris dataset",
  // nextStatement creates a point at the bottom of the block for the next 
  // block to click onto
  "nextStatement": null,
  // specify the color based on how you group blocks
  // all our supplied data frame blocks will be the same color
  "colour": 65,
  // this block has a hat because no block can proceed it
  "style": {"hat":"cap"},
}
]);
```

With a pretty good looking block it was time to work on the **generator code**. By using the same unique ID, when the user hits `run` this is what the block actually does under the hood. I spent A LOT of time trying to bake my dataframe into this code. I mean, it seemed logical the data live inside the block because that's what the block does...

Turns out this mental model was oh so incredibly WRONG. When you click blocks together, you're creating a script as a string which you can then `eval` [WARNING: This is a security big programming no-no but I'm an Ecologist by training so it's fine for now].

Here's an example: the data-forge code `iris.where(row => (row.SepalLength = 5))` is the same as `iris %>% filter(SepalLength = 5)` I was trying to include the entire iris dataset within my generator code when all I needed to do was have a SEPERATE js file with all our desired datasets then have the following generator code:

```{javascript}
Blockly.JavaScript['data_iris'] = function(block) {
    return 'iris'
}
```

This block literally just returns the word iris. That's it. Day's of stress and imposter syndrome resulting in ONE WORD.

The filter block is a tiny bit more complicated, but with a drop down to change the column, a drop down for your operators, and an empty box to put a number of text (all specified in the `Blockly.Block` world) it results in the string `.where(row => row.SepalLength = 5)`.

Back in html world we use the function `workspaceToCode` to concatenate all the strings our blocks made
```{js}
var code = Blockly.JavaScript.workspaceToCode(demoWorkspace);
```

This is essentially the same as:

```{r}
code = paste("iris", ".filter(SepalLength = 5)", sep="")
code
```


Now we use the javascript `eval` function on the concatenated string to actually run the script. `document.getElementById("whereIWantMyOutput").innerHTML` is html laungage for specifying where you want this evaluated code to be displayed on your page [within a div I called "whereIWantMyOutput"]

```{js}
document.getElementById("whereIWantMyOutput").innerHTML = eval(code);
```

Creating the generator code is easy! Now that I'm just making strings I feel pretty optimistic about including blocks for any data transformation needs. My biggest success this week is I now have a correct Blockly mental model (a pretty huge success!). 

However, in true coder (read perpetual student) fashion, this leaves me with another challenge: if the block code cannot access the javascript how do I make my drop down menus dynamic? I don't want to have a filter block that ONLY applies to the iris dataset, and another that applies for mtcars? That wouldn't scale to users inputting their own data at all. More to come!
