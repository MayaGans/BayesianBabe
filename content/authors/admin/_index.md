I am PhD student at CU Boulder studying quantitative biology. I am currently an intern at RStudio designing a visual block based programming language. I demonstrate my love for live music creating inforgraphics for [JamBase.com](https://www.jambase.com/article/new-orleans-jazz-fest-after-dark-deep-dive)
