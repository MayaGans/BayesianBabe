I had an idea for a personal project using the data from a [friend's website](stats.thephish.fm) and asked if I could get the data to run some stats on it. "Sure, let me send you a .sql datadump real quick". Oh boy. "Thanks!" *WTF is a datadump?*

I have about a month's worth of knowledge of SQL, but even that is limited to using SQL on my university's computer inside a GUI. And now I have a 60 MB file. 

In this post I'm going to outline my workflow: from downloading the software to install a local database, to accessing the data in R. Here we go!

# Step 1: Download MySQL
I downloaded the MySQL community (read: free) version [from their website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=486026) clicking the series of links within the image below. Click on the Community (GPL) Download, then DOWNLOAD the first option, the MySQL Community Server. From there choose your operating system and the DMG archive. There are flashy buttons for a pay account but make sure to click "no thanks, just start my download"

Next I opened the DMG, mindlessly clicked through the defaults (including setting a password) opened up system preferences, looked for the MySQL icon, then clicked on it to find little green circles, an active MySQL instance.

# Step 2: MySQL Workbench
Following the same protocol as above, instead of choosing the community server we download Workbench, a GUI for MySQL. Once you open the DMG, drag the icon into the applications, then click on the little dolphin.

Because we are running an instance, you should be able to click on the local instance connection. That brings up the GUI!

# Step 3: Import Data

Alright, so now back to that `.sql` file I was given. I went to File > Run SQL script and clicked on my file but got an error. Turns out in order to import the file I needed to add the following lines to the top it (using the database_name of your choice):

```{js}
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
USE database_name;
```

Okay. NOW you can navigate to File > Run SQL script and the new data_base will import (you might have to refresh first!)

# Open this Puppy up in R!

I read 5 tutorials that all quickly glance over giving the function `dbConnect` your credentials. The first issue was with `user='root'` - **this is a security issue and my Mac would not connect!** Under users and privlages I created a new account called `mayagans` and I gave myself all the permissions. Up next: the password. When you initialize the database you **MUST USE LEGACY PASSWORD ENCRYPTION**, then it should be the same password. Under **server status I located my host name and port**

```{r}
library(RMySQL)
library(DBI)

db_con <- dbConnect(MySQL(), 
                    user='mayagans', 
                    password='Chickenbone1!', 
                    dbname='thephish_stats', 
                    host='Mayas-MacBook-Pro.local',
                    port = 3306)
```

I'm in! And now I can query my database in R. Can I put "proficient in SQL" on my resume now?
