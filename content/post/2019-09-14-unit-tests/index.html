<p>I want to cover a topic I was SUPER intimidated by and never exposed to but now have come to love very much - unit tests! I’m going to explain the families or <code>suites</code> of unit tests we use in TidyBlocks rather than speak in abstractions. That way, if you want to add a new function or embelish on an existing block, you’ll have an outlined workflow for how to add the proper testing to make sure your code is doing what you think it should.</p>
<div id="in-conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>In Conclusion</h1>
<p>That said I still have some questions about overall unit test best practices: Should <em>every</em> function you write have its own unit test? We’ve also been addressing another question - <em>How do you anticipate every use case of your functions; what happens when your unit test passes but your code still fails?</em> by adding tests with the same name as an opened github issue, but are there better preventative measures one can take</p>
