<p>I’ve gotten pretty far in the past year and a half or so of my limited JavaScript knowledge, but I still have some glaring gaps that I’d like to address. My familiarity with recursive functions ends after the classic fibonacci sequence or counter example. I found myself asking okay but when am I <em>actually</em> going to use this? There must be a time were recursion will shine and I can’t just brute force my way through with a for loop…. right?</p>
<div id="hierarchical-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Hierarchical Data!</h2>
<p>Enter hierarchical data. Let’s say you have hierarchical data represented in a flat structure. Here we have elements with an id, that each have a parent element. At the highest level we have body which doesn’t have a parent element, but both <code>hand</code> and <code>foot</code> have the <code>body</code> parent. Then <code>finger</code> has the parent <code>hand</code> and <code>toe</code> the parent <code>foot</code>. Let’s structure this data as a tree to represent these relationships better!</p>
<pre><code>let anatomy = {
 { id: &#39;body&#39;,   parent: null },
 { id: &#39;hand&#39;,   parent: &#39;body&#39; },
 { id: &#39;finger&#39;, parent: &#39;hand&#39; },
 { id: &#39;foot&#39;,   parent: &#39;body&#39; },
 { id: &#39;toe&#39;,    parent: &#39;foot&#39; }
}</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="the-recursive-function" class="section level2">
<h2>The recursive function</h2>
<p>The logic behind our recursive function is that we need a function that will filter for each unique parent, then look for all the id’s that share that parent. Then the recursive function calls itself in order to make those id’s the next level’s parents:</p>
<pre><code>
let makeTree = (categories, parent) =&gt; {
  // create a variable we can manipulate
  let node = {}
  
  categories
     // get the root parent (supplied in function as arg)
    .filter(c =&gt; c.parent === parent)
     // get all the ids with the specified parent
    .forEach(c =&gt; node[c.id] = 
      // now make this same tree, 
      // but here we use the current id as the parent
      makeTree(categories, c.id))
  // the variable we manipulate is our output
  return node
}

console.log(JSON.stringify(makeTree(anatomy, null)), null, 2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>{
  body: {
    hand: {
     finger: {}
   },
    foot: {
     toe: {}
   }
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>In the first loop, we pass in our object, <code>anatomy</code> and also pass in the root parent: <code>null</code>. For every body part we use <code>forEach</code> to assign the node (<code>body</code>) and give it the return value of the same function, but this time we’re not passing in <code>anatomy</code>, we’ve passed in <code>body</code> so it will return <code>hand</code> and <code>foot</code> - and we recurse down assigning <code>finger</code> and <code>toe</code> respectively. This recursion happens all the way down until there are not properties left to assign.</p>
<p>This tree structure makes it quite obvious that body contains both hand and foot, which contains finger and toe respectively. A little more practical than the fibonacci sequence example if you ask me…</p>
</div>
