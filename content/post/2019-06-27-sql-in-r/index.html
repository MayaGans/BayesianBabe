<p>I had an idea for a personal project using the data from a <a href="https://stats.thephish.fm/">friend’s website</a> and asked if I could get the data to run some stats on it. “Sure, let me send you a .sql datadump real quick”. Oh boy. “Thanks!” <em>WTF is a datadump?</em></p>
<p>I have about a month’s worth of knowledge of SQL, but even that is limited to using SQL on my university’s computer inside a GUI. And now I have a 60 MB file.</p>
<p>In this post I’m going to outline my workflow: from downloading the software to installing a local database, to accessing the data in R. Here we go!</p>
<div id="step-1-download-mysql" class="section level1">
<h1>Step 1: Download MySQL</h1>
<p>I downloaded the MySQL community (read: free) version <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=486026">from their website</a> clicking the series of links within the image below. Click on the Community (GPL) Download, then DOWNLOAD the first option, the MySQL Community Server. From there choose your operating system and the DMG archive. There are flashy buttons for a pay account but make sure to click “no thanks, just start my download”</p>

</div>
<p>Next I opened the DMG, mindlessly clicked through the defaults (including setting a password) opened up system preferences, looked for the MySQL icon, then clicked on it to find little green circles, an active MySQL instance.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div id="step-2-mysql-workbench" class="section level1">
<h1>Step 2: MySQL Workbench</h1>
<p>Following the same protocol as above, instead of choosing the community server, I downloaded Workbench, a GUI for MySQL. Once I opened the DMG, dragged the icon into the applications, then clicked on the little dolphin I was up and running!</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>Because I am running an instance, I’m now able to click on the local instance connection. That brings up the GUI.</p>

<div id="step-3-import-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Step 3: Import Data</h1>
<p>Alright, so now back to that <code>.sql</code> file I was given. I went to File &gt; Run SQL script and clicked on my file but got an error. Turns out in order to import the file I needed to add the following lines to the top it (using the database_name of your choice):</p>
<pre class="js"><code>CREATE DATABASE database_name;
USE database_name;</code></pre>
<script type="text/javascript">
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
USE database_name;
</script>
<p>Okay. NOW I successfully navigates to File &gt; Run SQL script and the new data_base imported (you might have to refresh first!)</p>
</div>
<div id="open-this-puppy-up-in-r" class="section level1">
<h1>Open this Puppy up in R!</h1>

<p>I read 5 tutorials that all quickly glance over giving the function <code>dbConnect</code> your credentials. The first issue was with <code>user='root'</code> - <strong>this is a security issue and my Mac would not connect!</strong> Under users and privileges I created a new account called <code>mayagans</code> and I gave myself all the permissions. Up next: the password. When you initialize the database you <strong>MUST USE LEGACY PASSWORD ENCRYPTION</strong>, then it should be the same password. Under <strong>server status I located my host name and port</strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(RMySQL)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: package &#39;RMySQL&#39; was built under R version 3.5.2</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Loading required package: DBI</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>library(DBI)

db_con &lt;- dbConnect(MySQL(), 
                    user=&#39;mayagans&#39;, 
                    password=&#39;XXXXX&#39;, 
                    dbname=&#39;thephish_stats&#39;, 
                    host=&#39;Mayas-MacBook-Pro.local&#39;,
                    port = 3306)</code></pre>
<p>I’m in! And now I can query my database in R. Can I put “proficient in SQL” on my resume now?</p>
